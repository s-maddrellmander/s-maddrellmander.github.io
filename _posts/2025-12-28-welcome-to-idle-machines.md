## Hello

This site collects technical notes on a few topics I find interesting in machine learning. Some training, some maths, some thoughts, a bit of code. 
It's basically just for me, I'm not really expecting anyone to come and find it, but if you're here I hope you find something at least a little interesting.

### What to Expect

- **Project Write-ups**: Over the year as I work through projects you can expect me to document them here, let's say semi-consistently? Currently interested in exploring more RL and low precision LLM training. 
- **Theory & Practice**: Like lots of people, I like both. There will be a mix of engineering / implimentation and some maths.
- **Weekly Notes**: I'm considering trying to keep a regular cadence? Maybe. Mostly just for my own accountability. We'll see how long that lasts. 


Honestly, this is basically just for me. If anybody reads anything and like it I'd love to hear from you! But that's not the goal.

_More to come. Stay tuned._
